# Pharmfinder
Pharmfinder is a web application that lets the user search for a healthcare service (ie. first aid, medication review, vaccinations, etc.). The search runs through our external database and displays which pharmacies within Edmonton provide the healthcare service being searched for. The information displayed includes the name of the pharmacy, its address, and links to a list of the services provided and its location on Google Maps.
